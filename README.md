# Zindagi101: AI-Powered Lung Cancer Prediction using TP53 and Genetic Changes
Zindagi101: AI-Powered Lung Cancer Prediction
Overview
Zindagi101 is a groundbreaking deep learning project designed for the early prediction of lung cancer. Utilizing advanced AI models, this project aims to identify potential cancer markers up to three years before clinical symptoms manifest. By leveraging deep learning on vast datasets, Zindagi101 seeks to provide a crucial tool for early diagnosis and preventative care, potentially saving countless lives.

Features
Early Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of lung cancer up to three years in advance.

Deep Learning Model: Employs a sophisticated deep learning architecture trained on medical datasets.

Preventative Healthcare: Serves as a proactive tool for medical professionals to recommend early intervention.

Scalable Architecture: Built on a modular foundation that can be adapted for other predictive healthcare applications.

Technology Stack
Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Environment: Docker (Recommended for easy setup)

How It Works
The system operates by analyzing specific data inputs (e.g., medical scans, patient history data) and running them through a highly-optimized deep learning model. This model has been trained on a massive historical dataset to recognize subtle patterns and indicators that are imperceptible to the human eye. The output provides a probability score, indicating the risk of future cancer development.
